# Where to find moi 

This is my very first portfolio. While it was a need for me to create more visibility for myself by creating a portfolio. I also wanted to explore more about static websites, very popular these days and used Gatsby and Netlify in doing so. I chose an amazing template (see acknowledgements below) and off I went.

It was not easy at the beginning to go through someone elses code and decipher it as well as break it to see how it worked and behaved, but it was a really interesting and rewarding exercises and as a reward a got to deploy my first portfolio, which I hope will give me a further little push in my work search.
